# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- **Get Deflators Functions**: New functions to retrieve deflator data directly as DataFrames without requiring user data:
  - `get_imf_gdp_deflators()`, `get_imf_cpi_deflators()`, `get_imf_cpi_e_deflators()`
  - `get_wb_gdp_deflators()`, `get_wb_gdp_linked_deflators()`, `get_wb_cpi_deflators()`
  - `get_oecd_dac_deflators()`
- **Get Exchange Rates Functions**: New functions to retrieve exchange rate data directly as DataFrames:
  - `get_imf_exchange_rates()`, `get_wb_exchange_rates()`
  - `get_wb_ppp_rates()`, `get_oecd_dac_exchange_rates()`
- **Flexible Filtering**: All new functions support optional filtering by countries and years via `countries` and `years` parameters.
- **Component Breakdown**: `include_components=True` parameter for deflator functions to retrieve price deflator, exchange deflator, and exchange rate components separately for analysis.

### Changed
- Documentation: Updated README.md with extensive examples of the new get deflator and exchange rate functions.
- Documentation: Added new section "Getting Deflators and Exchange Rates Directly" with common use cases.

### Use Cases
The new functions enable:
- Inspecting and analyzing deflator trends over time
- Pre-computing deflators for custom calculations
- Understanding the components that make up deflators
- Retrieving exchange rates for analysis without converting data

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- **Plugin Architecture**: Register custom data sources without modifying pydeflate code via `register_source()`, `get_source()`, `list_sources()`, and `is_source_registered()`.
- **Context Management**: New `PydeflateContext` class and context managers (`pydeflate_session()`, `temporary_context()`) for dependency injection, enabling multiple independent cache directories and thread-safe parallel operations.
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Comprehensive custom exceptions including `PydeflateError` (base), `NetworkError`, `ConfigurationError`, `DataSourceError`, `CacheError`, `MissingDataError`, `SchemaValidationError`, and `PluginError` for fine-grained error handling.
- **Protocol Definitions**: Explicit `SourceProtocol`, `DeflatorProtocol`, and `ExchangeProtocol` interfaces in `protocols.py` for better type safety and extensibility.
- **Schema Validation**: Optional Pandera-based validation for IMF, World Bank, and OECD DAC data sources to catch data quality issues early (enable via `PYDEFLATE_ENABLE_VALIDATION` environment variable or context).
- **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis tests verifying mathematical properties (deflation reversibility, exchange rate transitivity, rebasing invariants).
- **Constants Module**: Centralized constants in `constants.py` eliminating magic strings (`PydeflateColumns`, `CurrencyCodes`, `DataSources`, etc.).
- **Enhanced Caching**: New `CacheManager` class with thread-safe file locking via `filelock` and platform-appropriate cache directories via `platformdirs`.
- New dependency: `pandera>=0.20.0` for schema validation.
- New dependency: `platformdirs>=3.0.0` for cross-platform cache directories.
- New dependency: `filelock>=3.15.0` for thread-safe cache operations.
- New dev dependency: `hypothesis>=6.122.3` for property-based testing.

### Fixed
- Corrected `to_current=True` parameter behavior which was resulted in incorrect calculations
in certain edge cases.

### Changed
- **Build System**: Migrated from Poetry to uv for faster dependency resolution and builds.
- **Project Structure**: Adopted src-based layout (`src/pydeflate/` instead of `pydeflate/`) following modern Python packaging best practices.
- **Python Version**: Minimum required version increased from 3.10 to 3.11.
- **Core Architecture**: Rewrote `core/source.py` with cleaner abstractions and improved `Source` class implementation.
- **Source Modules**: Enhanced `sources/common.py`, `sources/dac.py`, `sources/imf.py`, and `sources/world_bank.py` with better error handling and validation.
- **Configuration**: Expanded `pydeflate_config.py` with `set_data_dir()` function; `set_pydeflate_path()` now wraps `set_data_dir()` for backward compatibility.

### Improved
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Reorganized tests into `unit/`, `integration/`, `regression/`, and `property/` directories with comprehensive fixtures in `conftest.py`.
- **Type Safety**: Added type hints throughout the codebase and protocol definitions for better IDE support and static analysis.
- **Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages with source context and actionable guidance.
- **Documentation**: Added advanced usage examples in README covering error handling, plugin system, and context management.
- **Code Quality**: Consistent code formatting and linting with Ruff.

### Removed
- Poetry configuration files (`poetry.lock`, `poetry.toml`).
- Obsolete test files (`tests/test_dac_deflator.py`, `tests/test_dac_totals.py`, `tests/test_wb_ppp_exchange.py`), replaced by improved test suite.
